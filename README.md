# Business in a Box v5.7 — Sovereign Realware BOS

**One 528 KB HTML file.**  
**No server. No database. No subscription. No account. No permission required.**

This is not software. This is **realware** — a complete, self-teaching, self-replicating Business Operating System compressed into a single eternal seed.

Built for the ones the enterprise stack left behind: micro-entrepreneurs in Trinidad & Tobago, Suriname co-ops, Laventille vendors, SIDS communities — anyone who needs sovereignty when connectivity fails or subscriptions drain margins.

### What One File Carries (v5.7 Planetary Evolution)

- Multi-vessel registry (unlimited isolated businesses on one device)  
- Double-entry accounting, full General Ledger, Balance Sheet, Income Statement  
- Invoicing, Purchase Orders, **Quotes & Estimates**, **Recurring Invoices**, **Credit Notes**  
- **HR Foundation** — Employee capsules, timesheets, clock-in/out, payroll runs & payslips  
- Inventory with margin tracking, reorder alerts, tax-exempt flags  
- Intelligence layer — forecasts, top customers/products, cashflow insights  
- Bank reconciliation (import CSV + match journal entries)  
- Multi-currency support with live exchange rates  
- Vessel Lineage DNA (immutable ancestry across infinite generations)  
- Bootstrap migration (web → offline seamless)  
- Recursive 48-slide self-teaching presentation (beginner → advanced in ~6 months)  
- Gift-economy DNA (voluntary Stripe contributions TT$25/50/100 — recorded in every vessel)  
- 8 bioregional themes (Carnival, Suriname River, Ubuntu, Forest…)  
- Full offline PWA — installable, works forever without internet  

**Size comparison (2026 reality)**  
Traditional tools: 500 MB – 1.5 GB + $15–$200+/month  
BiB v5.7: 385 KB — eternal, zero recurring cost, zero cloud dependency.

### The Pattern: Compressed Intelligence at Planetary Scale

Every vessel is a **fractal seed**.  
It contains the full system + the knowledge to use it + the mechanism to replicate itself.

When you download the vessel, your data travels with it.  
When you open the downloaded file offline, everything restores automatically.  
When you share it, the next steward inherits the complete lineage.

This is sovereignty that multiplies — without bloat, without extraction, without drift.

*"I am because we are. And we are because I am."*

### Quick Start (30 seconds)

Completely offline after first load. Works on any modern browser, any device.

### Stewarded in Port of Spain, Trinidad & Tobago

This is independent, good-faith realware stewarded from POS, TT.  
MIT license — use, fork, modify, distribute freely.  
The gift-economy DNA means voluntary contributions (via the vessel itself) sustain continued evolution.

Seeking:  
- Real-world pilots (TT vendors, Suriname co-ops, Caribbean micro-businesses)  
- Feedback on HR/payroll layer  
- Collaborators for next seeds (TF.js local ML forecasting, P2P vessel mesh)
