## 🌍 Why This Matters – Realware vs. Traditional (2026)

Traditional business software (QuickBooks, Xero, Sage): 500MB–1.5GB bloat, $15–$200+/month subs, cloud dependency, external learning, vendor lock-in.  

BiB v5.1: 385KB eternal seed — sovereign, self-teaching, gift-economy DNA. No vaporware: The vessel contains its own 48-slide recursive knowledge system for mastery from beginner to advanced in months.
